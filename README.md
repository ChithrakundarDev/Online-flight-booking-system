# ✈ Online Flight Booking System

This is a simple web-based *Online Flight Booking System* built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to view available flights and simulate the process of booking a flight in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🧑‍💻 Project Description

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a front-end-based booking system where users can:

- View available flight details
- Select a flight and book it
- Get confirmation feedback (simulated)

This project was developed as part of my web development internship at *Vault of Codes*.
